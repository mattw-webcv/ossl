# Security Policy

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose them.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, please report it privately to the maintainers rather than publicly disclosing it.  
You may report issues via e-mail to:

ðŸ“§ **[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL HERE]**

Please include the following in your report:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any known or suggested mitigations.

We aim to acknowledge your report within **5 working days** and provide a resolution or update within **30 days** where possible.

## Supported Versions

We currently support and maintain only the latest version of this project.  
Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Public Disclosure

We prefer to coordinate a public disclosure with the reporter once a fix is ready.  
If you believe the vulnerability poses an immediate significant risk, please indicate this in your report and we will work with you to address it urgently.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure!
