# Rationale

The Open Source Synthesised Licence (OSSL) was created in response to a number of recurring challenges observed in the landscape of open source, free software, and corporate licensing. This document explains the reasoning behind the design of OSSL and the principles it seeks to uphold.

---

## 1. Addressing Complexity and Ambiguity

The proliferation of open source licences — often with subtle but significant differences — has led to confusion for creators and users alike. Many licences rely on language that is overly legalistic, verbose, and inaccessible to the average reader.

**OSSL seeks to:**
- Simplify the language where possible, while preserving legal robustness.
- Provide a modular structure that separates core principles from optional conditions.
- Make obligations and freedoms clear through explicit Options and defaults.

---

## 2. Balancing Freedom and Protection

Many free and open source licences prioritise user freedom at the expense of the creator’s economic or reputational interests, while others impose sweeping restrictions that deter collaboration.

**OSSL aims to strike a balance:**
- Upholding the freedoms of use, study, modification, and redistribution central to the FOSS ethos.
- Allowing licensors to protect their commercial interests through royalties and commercial-use Options.
- Ensuring proper attribution and preserving the integrity of the original work.

## 3. Modularity and Flexibility

Rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all model, OSSL provides a clear, modular set of Options that can be explicitly selected and communicated. This allows the licence to be adapted to a wide range of projects, contexts, and priorities without sacrificing transparency.

**Benefits include:**
- Clear Option Codes that eliminate ambiguity.
- Defaults that provide sensible protections if no Options are specified.
- Flexibility for both individual and organisational creators.

## 4. Ethical Considerations

Licences rarely address the potential for harm arising from unethical use, such as contributing to human rights violations, environmental destruction, or oppressive regimes.

**OSSL explicitly includes an ethical-use Option by default, requiring licensees to respect basic ethical principles when using the work.**

This is not intended to impose political ideology but to set a baseline of responsible behaviour.

---

## 5. Transparency and Usability

The OSSL is designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable, ensuring that both legal professionals and everyday users can understand and apply it.

**Key usability features:**
- A clear Foundation section that sets out the core rights and obligations.
- A Defaults Table that summarises the baseline conditions.
- A concise system of Option Codes for specifying variations.

## 6. Reinforcing Collaboration

OSSL encourages collaborative development by ensuring that derivative works remain open and that improvements can be shared back to the community. The default Share-Alike (copyleft) and attribution requirements support an ecosystem of mutual respect and shared benefit.

---

## Conclusion

The Open Source Synthesised Licence is an attempt to combine the best aspects of existing licences with innovations that address their weaknesses. By emphasising clarity, flexibility, fairness, and responsibility, OSSL offers creators and users a practical, ethical, and comprehensible framework for sharing and building upon creative works.
