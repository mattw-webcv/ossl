# OSSL Options

This document defines the optional modules (“Options”) that may be selected by the Licensor to customise the Open Source Synthesised License (OSSL) for a particular Licensed Work.

Each Option modifies, strengthens, or weakens the Foundation terms in a clearly defined and transparent way. The chosen Options are identified by their respective **Option Codes**, which the Licensor may append to the licence name or otherwise specify in accompanying documentation.

Unless explicitly overridden by the Licensor through inclusion of the relevant Option Code, the defaults specified in the Foundation section of the licence apply.

# Notes

- Option Codes should be written clearly and consistently when used, e.g.:  
  `OSSL-v1.0-CU2-R1-A2`  
  This denotes OSSL version 1.0 with Commercial Use prohibited (`CU2`), Royalties required (`R1`), and Enhanced Attribution (`A2`), with all other defaults applying.
  
- If no Option Code is specified for an Option Group, the default for that group applies.
